# ðŸŽ¬ Movie API

A simple Node.js project that demonstrates how to use built-in modules (`http`, `url`, and `fs`) to:

- Run a basic web server  
- Serve HTML files (`index.html` and `documentation.html`)  
- Log every request with a timestamp into `log.txt`  

This is part of a learning project.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Serves `index.html` when visiting the home page (`/`)
- Serves `documentation.html` when visiting `/documentation`
- Logs each request URL and timestamp into `log.txt`
